# primitive-box

[![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

A minimal box geometry for 3D rendering, NOT including normals, UVs. Only vertices and cell indices (faces).

You are probably looking for [primitive-cube](http://github.com/vorg/primitivie-cube). The difference is that cube has separate faces that can be textured while box does not. This is one solid mesh which makes it perfect for subdivisions.
